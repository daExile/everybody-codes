# Everybody Codes
## Let's have some more coding fun, hey
Might contain trace amounts of decent code (no promises).

Setting this up similarly to AoC repo, so...

## on "Rules"
- One source file per puzzle day, giving all parts' answers (not counting custom utility functions or recurring code moved to separate modules).
- Only standard package libraries for a given language are used.
- No automated input downloads set up, toss the "good ol" text files with two-digit day number name `DD.txt` into the `__in` folder.
- No serious input validity checks either, it works under assumption that a legit puzzle input is provided. Sometimes, there might more assumptions made about data structure of said input (that I would patch if I get to know that it causes certain valid inputs to explode).

## on Languages
- 2014: Lua for starters, will see if anything else
